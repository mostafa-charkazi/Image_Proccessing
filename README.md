# Image Processing Toolkit

This repository contains a collection of tools and scripts for image processing tasks.
It is designed for educational purposes, experiments, and research in image processing.

## Project Structure

### 1. `fft2` - Fast Fourier Transform
This folder contains scripts and tools to explore the effects of **phase** and **magnitude** in images.  
The main functionality involves:
- Applying FFT to two images.
- Manipulating the phase or magnitude of these images.
- Reconstructing and visualizing the effect of these manipulations.

### 2. `conv2` - Convolution Filters
This folder includes tools for creating and applying custom filters to images using convolution operations.  
The main features include:
- Defining custom filters.
- Applying filters to images.
- Visualizing the effects of the filters on the processed images.
