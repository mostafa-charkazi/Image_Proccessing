# High-Pass Filter for Edge Detection

This folder contains a Matlab script for applying a **high-pass filter** to images. High-pass filtering is a fundamental image processing technique used to enhance edges and emphasize regions with significant intensity changes, making it particularly useful for edge detection.

## Features

- **High-Pass Filtering**: Detect and enhance edges in an image by removing low-frequency components.
- **Customizable Kernel**: Modify the filter kernel for different high-pass effects.
- **Visualization**: Display the original and processed images side-by-side for comparison.
