# Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) - Phase and Magnitude Analysis

This folder contains scripts and tools to explore the effects of **phase** and **magnitude** in images using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Understanding the role of these components is critical for advanced image processing and reconstruction.

## Features

- **FFT Analysis**: Decompose images into their frequency components using FFT.
- **Phase and Magnitude Manipulation**:
  - Swap the phase of one image with another.
  - Analyze how changes to the phase or magnitude affect image reconstruction.
- **Visualization**: Display the original and manipulated images for comparison.
